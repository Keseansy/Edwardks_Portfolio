                <p>The aim of this project was to create packaging for a new candy product.</p>

                <p>I spent a good amount of time in the sketching and planning phases and eventually decided on the Pixel Bytes idea.</p>
            
                <p>From there, I created digital iterations of pixels and cube designs until I decided that an isometric grid system would work best for the design. It gave the packaging that wow factor it needed to pop.</p>

                <p>The aim of this project was to create a series of textbook covers that represented the three areas of bioremediation: microbial remediation, phytoremediation, and mycoremediation.
        
                <p>The outcome was meant to have roots in science while retaining a sense of visual intrigue and modernism.
            
                <p>The project entailed extensive research into bioremediation so that I would have a deeper understanding of the subject when designing for it.</p>
